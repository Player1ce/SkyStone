USAGE:
    ftc_http_win.exe [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [DIRS]...

FLAGS:
    -b, --build
            Builds the code on the robot controller.

            Initiates a build on the robot controller and reports the build status and any errors back to the user.
    -d, --download
            Download .java files from the robot controller.

            Source files are saved to the location specified in DIRS. This defaults to the current directory.

            Files on the local computer are never deleted by ftc_http, though old files with the same name are
            overwritten. Be sure to save to a fresh location if you don't want to risk overwriting old source files.
    -h, --help
            Prints help information

        --restore-defaults
            Reset the host and timeout values to their defaults.

            This deletes any custom values that have been automatically remembered.
    -u, --upload
            Uploads .java files to the robot controller.

Uploads files from the location specified in DIRS. Defaults to the current directory. Source files are recursively located by their .java extension.

    -V, --version
            Prints version information

    -w, --wipe
            Wipes all files from the robot controller.

            Using this option ensures that files deleted on the local machine are also deleted on the robot controller.
            Be cautious and make a backup with the -d option before wiping anything.

OPTIONS:
        --host <ADDR>
            Manually specify the address of the robot controller.

            Addresses are given in the form: "http://<IP>:<PORT>"
        --timeout-ms <DELAY>
            Manually specify the connection timeout.

            Wait at least this long before declaring a robot controller offline (given in milliseconds).

ARGS:
    <DIRS>...
            A list of directories used by the download and upload options.

            Between 0 and 2 directories can be specified. When -d and -u are used together, the first directory is
            where files are downloaded and the second is where they are uploaded from.


org dir home: ‘Program Files/SKystone_PC_2/SkyStone/TeamCode/src/main/java/org’
must download from this dir home: ‘D:\Program Files\SKystone_PC_2\SkyStone\TeamCode\src\main\java’
